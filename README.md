# Zesty-Bytes

## Description

**Project 1 for Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp**

Our project focuses on delivering a user-friendly experience for snack enthusiasts searching for finger-food recipes. Our streamlined platform eliminates the hassle of ads and unnecessary content, ensuring a quick and efficient recipe search. Users can easily search by recipe name and view six curated options with images. Alternatively, a unique checkbox system allows ingredient-based searches for those with specific preferences.

The search bar features a convenient history of recent searches for quick access. Upon selecting a recipe, users are presented with a modal displaying essential details such as cook time, rating, and serving size alongside an engaging image. Our commitment to transparency is showcased on the home page, where a direct link to our GitHub repository highlights project contributors and their role as code contributors, fostering a collaborative community. Our goal is to provide a seamless and enjoyable snacking experience for users seeking hassle-free access to finger-food recipes.
